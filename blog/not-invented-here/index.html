<p>&ldquo;There are lots of viable paths through engineering. The path I advocate for is &lsquo;knowledge in depth&rsquo; - for knowing things really deeply. It&rsquo;s true that the modern wizardry of building amazing applications by bashing together a bunch of JavaScript libraries and web services has indeed minted a lot of startup millionaires, but it does remind me of Mickey Mouse as the sorcerer&rsquo;s apprentice in Fantasia animating broomsticks with magic he doesn&rsquo;t really understand and eventually making a really big mess. Knowing how to pull the levers of power is rewarding, but there&rsquo;s a satisfaction in really understanding how they work and knowing things very deeply. There&rsquo;s also a great confidence you can have when you know that you could build something from scratch even if you choose not to. Almost everything that we work with has really great depths to explore. Now you can&rsquo;t know everything, but you should look at this as you can know anything. Anything that you turn your attention to that you choose to focus on you can understand. Nothing is magic, and you can tear things apart if you need to to find the details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As programmers, we have an urge to write everything ourselves. I concede that this is irrational in many cases, but a large part of becoming a better programmer is not just writing a lot of code but writing lots of different code. Only writing gameplay code for years will make you a gameplay programming expert but not a good programmer. Being well-versed in different areas of programming is critical to your growth as an engineer. If you&rsquo;re a programmer making your own game engine, you should try implementing your own 3D model loader. Its almost always better to just use a pre-existing library to import 3D models, but even if you never end up actually using your own implementation you will have become a better programmer for having written a 3D model loader yourself. Knowing you won&rsquo;t actually use your implementation is liberating in a way because it gives you free license to write horrible code - just get something done and working and it&rsquo;ll have been an excellent learning exercise. This applies to every aspect of game engine development. And, like John Carmack says, there is great confident you can have when you know that you could build something from scratch even if you choose not to.</p>
