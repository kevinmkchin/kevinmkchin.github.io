      <description>I am by no means an expert in math, but having worked with linear algebra and math in 3D spaces for years now, I think it could be valuable to share some things that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and some common sources of confusion when it comes to working in 3D spaces. At the very least, I can provide some insight into working with 3D maths as a game or game engine developer.</description>

      <description>The California Institute of Technology archived a photograph of Richard Feynman&amp;rsquo;s blackboard at the time of his death.
At the top, Feynman wrote: &amp;ldquo;What I cannot create, I do not understand.&amp;rdquo; This is a quote that resonates with me strongly. It&amp;rsquo;s an idea that John Carmack, founder of id Software and pioneer of computer games, seems to agree with.
&amp;ldquo;There are lots of viable paths through engineering. The path I advocate for is &amp;lsquo;knowledge in depth&amp;rsquo; - for knowing things really deeply.</description>

      <description>Many computer games have a developer console or in-game console which provide a command-line interface for executing commands, changing game variables, or activating cheats. It&amp;rsquo;s a very useful feature seen in many games like Quake, Skyrim, Minecraft, and Counter-Strike. In this guide, I will explain how to add a complete developer console to your C++ game in 20 lines of code.
The following is an in-game console present in every Source game:</description>

      <description>When making a C++ executable on Windows, you have the option of choosing between a Windows app and a Console app. A Windows app is an app with a GUI Window, and a Console app runs in the terminal (e.g. Windows Command Prompt). By switching over a Windows App to a Console App, you will get a command prompt window accompanying your GUI program Window.
Linker Option Visual Studio or MSVC C++ Compiler Set the /SUBSYSTEM linker option of the MSVC compiler for your project to CONSOLE.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to find the perfect shell for Windows. There are some decent options out there (e.g. Cmder), but in many ways Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s own PowerShell (aka PoSh, PwSh, psh) is the best option for Windows. It&amp;rsquo;s also cross-platform! If you have workflow you are used to with PowerShell, you can have the same workflow regardless of the OS you&amp;rsquo;re on.
PowerShell stands out from other shells available on Windows because it&amp;rsquo;s more than just a command line for interacting with Windows.</description>
