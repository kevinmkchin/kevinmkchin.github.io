    a software developer at Unity. In the past, I’ve made computer games,
    plumbed graphics pipelines, created numerous softwares and libraries,

    <p>I'm an engine programmer at Ubisoft. In the past, I worked on the editor 
    at Unity, made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268750/Starship_Troopers_Extermination/">
    Starship Troopers: Extermination</a> at Offworld, and TA’ed computer graphics
    students at the University of British Columbia.</p> <!--<p>I have a lot
    of unfinished untitled coding projects. I'll be documenting some of the
    cool things that never saw the light of day in the writings section of my
    website.</p>--> <p>My homepage has a selected list of hobby and
    professional projects I've worked on. The others that aren't showcased
    can probably be found on my GitHub. Either that or they are lost to the
    sands of time.</p> <!--<p>3,1 MMR in StarCraft 2</p>-->
