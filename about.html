    <p>Hi, my name is Myungkeon Kevin Chin, and I’m a software developer at Unity. In the past, I’ve made computer games, plumbed graphics pipelines, created numerous softwares and libraries, and TA’ed computer graphics students at the University of British Columbia.</p>
    <p>Prior to Unity, I made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268750/Starship_Troopers_Extermination/">Starship Troopers: Extermination</a> at Offworld.</p>
    <p>I have a lot of unfinished untitled coding projects. I'll be documenting some of the cool things that never saw the light of day in the writings section of my website.</p>
    <p>My homepage has a selected list of hobby or professional projects I've worked on. The others that I'm embarrassed to showcase can probably be found on my GitHub. Either that or they are lost to the sands of time.</p>
