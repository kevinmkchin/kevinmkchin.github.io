      <description>GitHub &amp;ldquo;Hey, good luck on your engine.&amp;rdquo; - Noel Berry Aug 14, 2020 at a bouldering gym Purpose Ayax Development Kit is a collection of tools and resources that one would want in order to create a 2D video game. In essence, ADK is an easy-to-use C++ game engine for building modern 2D games, but it includes several useful game systems such as character controllers, cameras, and common game objects such as trigger boxes.</description>

      <title>Super Whiplash</title>

      <description>Steam Store Page I created an online multiplayer vehicular combat game inspired by Twisted Metal called Super Whiplash. This was a significant challenge because the built-in UE4 vehicle controller doesn&amp;rsquo;t work very well in multiplayer. I implemented an entirely new vehicle physics system with framerate independent physics. I networked vehicle physics (e.g. force, traction, etc.) in a way that would work with my system. The result is a bit janky but still more reliable than the built-in UE4 vehicle controller.</description>

      <description>GitHub This is a demonstration of a video game graphics rendering technique known as Raycasting (find out more about raycasting here: Raycasting Explained). Inspired by John Carmack&amp;rsquo;s implementation of raycasting in Wolfenstein 3D.
The tile map editor that I made to create levels for this the demo became a standalone tile map/level editor which I used for other projects: Bambuu TileMap Editor.
[W][A][S][D] to move.

      <description>Roguelike project that uses Perlin noise to procedurally generate the world.
I gained experience working with the concept of tiles in both 2 and 3 dimensions. This was very beneficial to me in my future projects such as the Bambuu Tilemap Editor, the Raycasting Demonstration, and the Arx Aeternus OpenGL game, all of which use some variation of tilemaps.
